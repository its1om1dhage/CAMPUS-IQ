CAMPUS‑IQ: Centralized Analytics and Management Platform for Unified Systems and Institutional Quality. 
This project focuses on developing a centralized, secure, and intelligent institutional management system that digitalizes academic and administrative records across multiple departments. It provides role‑based access, structured verification and approval workflows, and automated report generation. The system includes analytics, statistical insights, trend prediction, data summarization, and custom filtering to support institutional performance monitoring and quality assurance. By improving data accuracy, transparency, and efficiency, the platform enables faster, data‑driven decision‑making for faculty, administrators, and management.
